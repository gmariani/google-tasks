# Google Tasks
Google Tasks is an Adobe AIR app that allows you to view/edit/add/delete tasks without your browser.
It is similar to Christian's found [here](http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2009/12/google_tasks_on_your_desktop.html), but with some added features.
Circa 2010-2012

# Added Features
Added option for different views (complex, simple, android, iphone, mobile).
Added option for Always On Top.
Always on top - I wanted it always on top of my other windows.
Saves size and position - This way you are not resizing and moving it every time you open it.
